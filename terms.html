            <p class="mb-3 text-justify">
              These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us
              on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire
              agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
              exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms
              shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These
              Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may
              assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any
              time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage,
              delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable
              control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal
              Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
              provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these
              Legal Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of
              any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership,
              employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a
              result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that
              these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of
              having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may
              have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack
              of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
